# Documentation Assets (Placeholders)

Store illustrations/GIFs for the docs here. Suggested filenames to keep things consistent:
- `sleep_flow.png` – two-stage sleep overview (Idle → Sleep → Wake triggers)
- `klipper_flags.png` – Moonraker/Klipper status fields used for wake
- `flash_tool_steps.png` – ESP32 Flash Download Tool settings screenshot
- `gif_placement.png` – Where to put tool GIFs in `data/gifs/`

Feel free to replace these with actual captures; the docs can reference them from `docs/images/`.
